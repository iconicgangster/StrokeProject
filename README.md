# StrokeProject
Data Mining Project on Prediction of Stroke using Machine Learning Techniques

This project aims to create a predictive model that reliably identifies people at risk of stroke based on their health characteristics. This classification problem predicts whether a person has a stroke or not with a good amount of accuracy. 

Used two data mining techniques: Logistic regression and Decision trees. The one with the better accuracy is our final model. 
Response variable is non-numeric. It is categorical with two classes: stroke/no stroke. 

Note : This analysis is a standalone project to develop the predictive model. However, the application and refinement of the model can become an ongoing procedure in future. In order to make sure the model stays useful and relevant over time, it could be required to update the model with new data on a regular basis and optimize the algorithms.
